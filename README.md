# Sylvester

Sylvester is a high-performance single header advanced mathematics library designed
mainly for 3D Graphics applications such as OpenGL, Direct3D, and Vulkan. It focuses
on simplicity, usability, and performance. Sylvester works only on C++.

Sylvester has both C and CPP version. The CPP version uses operator and funtion overloading with the ```Syl``` namespace.
C version uses ```s_``` prefix and all operations have to be done explicity with functions.

## [Visit the docs for usage](https://github.com/xcatalyst/Sylvester/blob/master/docs/README.md)

## Feature Support
Sylvester is not a finished library. It will take time for me to implement all the functions 
necessary and fix all the bugs. Currently, Sylvester supports:
* Utility Functions
* Vector 2D
* Vector 3D
* Vector 4D
* Matrix 4x4

# NOTE:
Not all the functions are accelerated with SIMD, I have limited time to work on this
project so some of the functions might be slow. New features will be added over time.
This is not a complete math library and it's still in beta so use it at your own risk!
If you encounter any bugs please report them from the Issues section on GitHub.
